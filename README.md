# Reducing_road_accidents

This is an approach to reduce road accidents. When any pedestrian comes near the vehicle, the motor of vehicle stops automatically avoiding the road accidents. Accidents can cause physical, financial and mental effects to everyone involved. The pedestrian detection is done using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). The distance between the pedestrian and vehicle is calculated using Ultrasonic sensors. These ultrasonic sensors are placed in front of the vehicle. The micro-controller used in Raspberry PI. Raspberry PI is used for interfacing with the motor and ultrasonic sensors.
